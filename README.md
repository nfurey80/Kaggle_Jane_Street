Jane Street Kaggle Competition

The goal is to train a model based upon historical marketing data. This model will look at upcoming trades and decide whether each trade will result in a positive or negative return and label them as such. The data given to train the model has 130 features, no of which have been named. The data has around 2.5 million rows of data, over a time period of 500 days. All relevent data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/data.
